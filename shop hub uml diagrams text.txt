1️⃣ UML Component Diagram — Explanation
🔹 What this diagram represents

The Component Diagram shows the logical structure of the e-commerce system.
It explains what software components exist and how they interact with each other.

🔹 Components in the diagram (ShopHub example)
1. Client Layer

Web Browser

Mobile App

These are the user interfaces through which customers access the system.

2. Frontend Layer

Frontend UI

This component:

Displays pages to users

Sends user requests to backend services

Receives responses and updates the UI

3. Backend Services

User Service – handles login, registration, user data

Product Service – manages product details and inventory

Cart Service – manages shopping cart operations

Order Service – processes orders

Payment Service – handles payment processing

Each service is independent, which makes the system modular.

4. Data Layer

Database

Stores:

User data

Product information

Orders

Cart details

5. External Service

Payment Gateway

An external system used to process online payments securely.

🔹 Why this diagram is important

Helps understand system structure

Shows separation of concerns

Makes the system easier to maintain and scale

Clearly shows how services depend on each other

🔹 Simple explanation line

The component diagram explains how the e-commerce system is divided into software components and how these components interact logically.

2️⃣ UML Deployment Diagram — Explanation
🔹 What this diagram represents

The Deployment Diagram shows the physical architecture of the system.
It explains where the software components run in the real world.

🔹 Nodes in the diagram
1. User Device

Web Browser

Mobile App

This is where users interact with the system.

2. Web Server

Hosts the Frontend UI

Handles incoming requests from users.

3. Application Server

Hosts Backend Services

Executes business logic like order processing and payment handling.

4. Database Server

Hosts the E-commerce Database

Stores all persistent system data.

5. External System

Payment Gateway

A third-party system used for secure payment transactions.

🔹 Why this diagram is important

Shows how the system is deployed physically

Helps in infrastructure planning

Improves understanding of network communication

Useful for DevOps and deployment decisions

🔹 Simple explanation line

The deployment diagram shows how the e-commerce system is physically deployed on different servers and how these servers communicate.
